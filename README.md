# OSS_final_project
This is final project for OSS class.

I operate simple matrix calculator service on raspberry pi.

I take linear algebra class this semester. While I learning linear algebra, there are so many troublesome calculations are required. Therefore, I think I could use this chance to make my own matrix calcultor.

I also utilize eigen library.
Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.

# What does this project do?
This project do simple matrix calculations.( Addition, Substraction, Multiplication)

# Why is this project useful?
This project will help you more easy to learn linear algebra. It will help annoying and incidental calculations during learning linear algebra. So, utilize my calculation and don't forgive up learning linear algebra!

# How do I get started?
1. turn on raspberry pi and log in your putty.
2. clone this repository(it's include eigen library.) under your any directory.
3. go into 'calculator' file and find executable file (that is a calculator).
4. when you execute the file, you can use it according to instructions.

# Where can I get more help, if I need it?
